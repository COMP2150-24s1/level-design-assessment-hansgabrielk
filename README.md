## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery
Throughout the level, the player learns the basics and extents of the game's mechanics. My level design structures learning by regularly testing the players understanding of the limitations of mechanics. A clear example of this is would be the first 3 jumps of Section #1. The first two jumps are easy and help familiarise the player with the jumping mechanic. The third jump, on the other hand, is designed in such a way that showcases the upper limits of the jump mechanic. Either side of the pit is level with the other and 6 units apart. At this distance, the player is required to jump at the last possible moment to clear the gap. Furthermore, the height of the right side of the pit is 6 units high. At this height, the player is unable to reach the top. The left side of the pit is elevated by 1 unit (5 blocks high). The player can reach the top of this side of the pit to reattempt the jump. This first test ensures that, moving forward, the player understands the limitations of the jump mechanic.

### 1.2. Drama
The peaks of intensity increase over the course of the level; modulated by the obtaining of keys. The end of each section has a difficult challenge that raises the intensity level significantly. Immediately after overcoming the challenge, the player is rewarded with respite and a key; bringing the intensity levels back down.

Each section also has smaller respite zones in the form of checkpoints and health pickups. These provide a short moment of relief but tension still remains as the player can still see obstacles ahead.

### 1.3. Challenge
There are 3 main challenges in my level.
1st Challenge: Hard Spike Jump
This jump at the end of Section #1 features the first instance of spikes on ceiling. Unlike the previous jumps, this jump limits the jump height of the player. The player must precisely control the power their jump as the not hit the spikes at the top or fall into the acid pool at the bottom.

A players initial attempts will cause frustration. To help mitigate this and keep the player in the flow state, I added a small rock. This rock indicates the exact moment the player must begin their jump in order to avoid both the spikes and the acid.

2nd Challenge: Jump and Shoot


3rd Challenge: Bunch of Enemies


### 1.4. Exploration
I will admit here that I did not read the assessment notification throughly enough as I did not design a non-linear level. As such, my level does not facilitate player autonomy for exploration. Despite this, my level does still aim to make each space distinct and memorable.
